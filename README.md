# Trainer-laser-pulse-reconstruction
Here I demonstrate how to train a convoluted neural network (CNN) that is able to recover the temporal profile of an X-ray pulse from electron time-of-flight (TOF) spectra in a light field streaking setup. A temporal resolution in the fs-regime is feasible using such a scheme.
